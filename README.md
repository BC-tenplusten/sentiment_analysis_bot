Description
The Sentiment Analysis Bot is a project that utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of text inputs. The bot aims to provide a quick and automated way to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of textual content, such as tweets, reviews, or customer feedback.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms and a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify the sentiment of input text. The model has been trained on a large dataset and is capable of providing accurate sentiment predictions.
